# Question 4: Simple Voting System
Task: Create a Python program to simulate a simple voting system for a two-candidate election. The program should ask the user to vote for one of two candidates (e.g., "Candidate A" or "Candidate B") and keep track of the votes each candidate receives. After a predetermined number of votes have been cast, the program should announce the winner based on who received more votes.

# Requirements:

Use a loop to collect votes until the vote count reaches a specified limit.
Use if statements to validate input and count votes for each candidate.
Handle cases where a user might enter invalid input.

# Expected Output:
```
Vote for Candidate A or Candidate B: A
Vote for Candidate A or Candidate B: B
Vote for Candidate A or Candidate B: A
Vote for Candidate A or Candidate B: C
Invalid vote. Please vote for either Candidate A or Candidate B.
Vote for Candidate A or Candidate B: B
Vote for Candidate A or Candidate B: A
Voting finished. Candidate A wins!

```
