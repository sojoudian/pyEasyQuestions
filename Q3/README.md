# Question 3: Error Log Parser
Task: Write a Python program that reads a list of error log messages and counts how many errors of each type are present. Assume each log entry is a string in a list and contains either "Error: Critical" or "Error: Minor" as part of the text. The program should output the count of critical and minor errors found.

# Requirements:

Use a loop to iterate over a list of log messages.
Implement if statements to categorize errors.
Handle the case where the list is empty.

# Example output

```javascript
Critical Errors: 2
Minor Errors: 2

```
