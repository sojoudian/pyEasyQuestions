# Question 8: Simple Math Quiz
Task: Create a Python program to implement a simple math quiz that asks the user to solve a basic arithmetic problem (e.g., addition, subtraction). The program should generate two random numbers and an operation (addition or subtraction) and then ask the user to solve the problem. If the user enters the correct answer, the program congratulates them. If the answer is incorrect or the input is invalid, the program should inform the user and allow them to try again.

# Requirements:

Use the random module to generate two random numbers and to choose between addition and subtraction.
Use a loop to allow the user to keep trying until they get the correct answer.
Use exception handling to catch non-numeric inputs.
Use if statements to check if the answer is correct.

# Expected Output:
```javascript
What is 3 + 7? 10
Congratulations! You've got the correct answer.
```
