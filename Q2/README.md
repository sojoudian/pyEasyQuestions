# Question 2: Simple ATM Interface
Task: Write a Python program that simulates a simple ATM interface allowing the user to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. Ensure the program handles invalid inputs and enforces that the user cannot withdraw more than their current balance.

# Requirements:
Use a loop to create a menu-driven interface that runs until the user chooses to exit.
Implement if statements to process user commands.
Use exception handling to manage non-numeric inputs.
Prevent overdrawing the account.

1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
