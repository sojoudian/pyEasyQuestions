# Question 6: Basic File Reader
Task: Write a Python program that asks the user for the name of a file to open and read. The program should print the contents of the file. If the file does not exist or the input is invalid, the program should handle these errors gracefully by informing the user and allowing them to try again.

# Requirements:

Use exception handling to catch errors related to file opening and invalid file names.
Use a loop to allow the user multiple attempts to enter a valid file name.
Use if statements to check the validity of the input.
