# Leap Year
## Question: 
#### Write a Python program to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

#### Background:
A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means that the year 2000 was a leap year, although 1900 was not. This adjustment is made because a complete orbit of the earth around the sun takes slightly less than 365.25 days. The extra day added every four years compensates for this discrepancy and helps keep our calendar in alignment with the earth's revolutions around the sun.
