# Question 1: Number Guessing Game
Task: Write a Python program to implement a simple number guessing game. The program should choose a random number between 1 and 20 and ask the user to guess the number. The user has unlimited attempts to guess the number correctly. If the guess is too high or too low, the program should inform the user accordingly. Once the user guesses the number correctly, the program should print a congratulatory message and exit.

# Requirements:

Use the random module to generate a random number.
Implement a loop to allow the user to make multiple guesses.
Use if statements to provide hints to the user.
Handle non-numeric inputs gracefully and prompt the user to enter a valid number.


## Usage/Examples

```javascript
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
Take a guess: abc
Please enter a valid number.
Take a guess: 21
Your guess is too high.
Take a guess: 10
Your guess is too low.
Take a guess: 15
Good job! You guessed my number 15!

```
